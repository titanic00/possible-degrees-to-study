                <p>In the school I used to be very bad in math. To be honest I was very lazy and I did't want to
                    study, so I had very bad marks in this school subject. <br> It's been a long time since then.
                    Now I realized that there is no subject that I want to study really hard as math. It turned out
                    I do
                    love solving <br> problems and learning difficult stuff to use it by solving problems.</p>

            <aside>
                <p>Data Science and Actuarial business are the most ineteresting topics for me. Most likely I will study
                    Data Science in
                    <a href="https://clck.ru/bLrJn" target="_blank">Hochschule
                        Hannover</a>.<br> But I still doubt so <a href="https://inlnk.ru/1PLB1O"
                        target="_blank">Hochschule
                        Rosenheim</a> is the second
                    option.

                <p>My love for computers has been going on since childhood. I even wanted to study to be a computer
                    programmer, but my GPA wasn't good <br> enough to get into college. Though I had a great time
                    and now
                    I'm encouraged enough to learn something new in this field beyond web-development.</p>

                <p>I'm sure I will be a software engineer if I choose computer science. <a
                        href="https://ai.htw-berlin.de/" target="_blank">Berlin</a> is very
                    suitable
                    to pursue this degree.

                <p>I have not much to say about my passion into this degree. I'm interested in developing new
                    hardwares, that's all.</p>

                <p>SIMULATIONS. Omg, I already know that this degree would suit to my interests and goals. Doing
                    researches and testing probably scientific <br> or commercy solutions are what I want to do!</p>
